Start Clean offers a minimal ui that replaces Google Chrome's default page.
It includes the top sites you visit, and shows your apps (both turned on in the settings). You can add your own custom links.

Start Clean New Tab Page has less features and options than alternatives such as Awesome New Tab Page, but it is cleaner, faster, and has only what you need.

Use Start Clean with your linux desktop to spice it up even more.
